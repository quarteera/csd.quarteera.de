Five years ago, Quarteera e. V. first took a stand in Marzahn, Berlin, for love, equality, and inclusivity.

This time, we are stepping out with the slogan "Queer as Freedom" to show solidarity with those fighting for their rights and freedoms, be it in the context of the LGBTQ+ community, political prisoners, journalists, activists, and all those deprived of their right to vote.

Today, as we celebrate this festival, we continue the fight for rights and recognition of our diversity, despite increasing challenges. The empowerment of right-wing forces such as the AfD in Germany, the ongoing war of Russia in Ukraine, and the spread of laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ+ people in countries bordering Russia remind us of the need to stand together against prejudice and hate.

The war of Russia in Ukraine continues, and we still call for humanitarian and military support for the country that is almost alone fighting against the totalitarian regime of Russia's illegitimate authorities. Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and other countries influenced by Russia are adopting laws and considering equating LGBTQ+ affiliation with extremism. Countries affected by the Kremlin's colonial policy are also developing a negative attitude towards the community. These trends are hard to overlook, and that's why Quarteera e. V., now at the fifth Pride in Marzahn, once again speaks about the fundamental principles of humanity and community.

- We fight for full inclusion and the protection of the rights of every member of the LGBTQ+ community. Our goal is equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

- We firmly stand against the rise of far-right forces and ideologies, as well as laws that suppress the freedom of LGBTQ+ people in the world.

- We defend the right to individuality and call for the recognition and celebration of our unique diversity.

- We condemn war and violence and advocate for the protection of human rights and support for all those affected by aggression and injustice.

- In a world full of contradictions and disputes, we call for unity around love - the true value of life.

Join us at Pride in Marzahn to celebrate our resilience in the face of time's challenges together. We are building bridges of mutual support and understanding, against discrimination, walls of prejudice, hate, and aggression. We insist on a world where equality and freedom are the fundamental rights of every individual.
