# Manifests

{{< collapse title="**2025: We are different. We are together.**" color="red">}}
Six years ago, we marched in Marzahn for the very first time. It was bold. It was a little scary.
But it was truly important. \
 \
Since then, we've marched with various slogans‚Äîinspiring and provocative, personal and political. But always sincere.
We‚Äôve come to speak openly ‚Äî about our rights, about our identities, about the freedom to be ourselves. \
 \
And over these years, we‚Äôve come a long way. And the most important part of this journey isn't just the fight
for visibility, but the opportunity to stand alongside others, to hear and to be heard. \
 \
Over six years, Marzahn Pride has become an event that unites very different people around simple yet crucial values:
acceptance, solidarity, respect, and the right to live without fear. \
 \
And we‚Äôre proud to be building this space together. \
 \
But we also see how society is becoming increasingly radicalized worldwide, and we fear where this might lead.
It's becoming more noticeable: people stop hearing and listening to each other, while fear and hatred
are used as politicians' primary tools. \
 \
Many of us know exactly what that looks like ‚Äî because we‚Äôve had to leave our homes, escaping authoritarian regimes,
wars, and dictatorships. \
 \
That's why participating in this pride isn't just an act of solidarity. It's a necessity. \
 \
We stand for open and honest conversation. We stand for bringing people together, not tearing them apart. We believe
that our greatest strength lies in our diversity ‚Äî in our ability to meet each other with respect, curiosity, and care.
That‚Äôs how we move forward. That‚Äôs how we build a better future. \
 \
**We say: We are different. We are together.** \
 \
And we invite everyone who shares these values ‚Äî everyone who believes in a world free from discrimination and violence
‚Äî to join us. Walk with us. Stand with us. For human rights. For dignity. For equality. For all of us.

Five years ago, Quarteera e. V. first took a stand in Marzahn, Berlin, for love, equality, and inclusivity. \
 \
This time, we are stepping out with the slogan "Queer as Freedom" to show solidarity with those fighting for their
rights and freedoms, be it in the context of the LGBTQ+ community, political prisoners, journalists, activists, and
all those deprived of their right to vote. \
 \
Today, as we celebrate this festival, we continue the fight for rights and recognition of our diversity, despite
increasing challenges. The empowerment of right-wing forces such as the AfD in Germany, the ongoing war of Russia
in Ukraine, and the spread of laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ+ people in countries bordering Russia remind us
of the need to stand together against prejudice and hate. \
 \
The war of Russia in Ukraine continues, and we still call for humanitarian and military support for the country that is
almost alone fighting against the totalitarian regime of Russia's illegitimate authorities. Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan, and other countries influenced by Russia are adopting laws and considering equating LGBTQ+ affiliation with
extremism. Countries affected by the Kremlin's colonial policy are also developing a negative attitude towards the community.
These trends are hard to overlook, and that's why Quarteera e. V., now at the fifth Pride in Marzahn, once again speaks
about the fundamental principles of humanity and community. \
 \
‚óè We fight for full inclusion and the protection of the rights of every member of the LGBTQ+ community. Our goal is equality
for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. \
 \
‚óè We firmly stand against the rise of far-right forces and ideologies, as well as laws that suppress the freedom of LGBTQ+
people in the world. \
 \
‚óè We defend the right to individuality and call for the recognition and celebration of our unique diversity. \
 \
‚óè We condemn war and violence and advocate for the protection of human rights and support for all those affected
by aggression and injustice. \
 \
‚óè In a world full of contradictions and disputes, we call for unity around love - the true value of life. \
 \
Join us at Pride in Marzahn to celebrate our resilience in the face of time's challenges together. We are building
bridges of mutual support and understanding, against discrimination, walls of prejudice, hate, and aggression.
We insist on a world where equality and freedom are the fundamental rights of every individual. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

We are proud of diversity and we are tired of stereotypes! We want to show the Russian-speaking residents of Berlin
that the LGBT+ community is just real and very different people. \
 \
We march on Marzan, the most Russian-speaking district in Berlin and, as they say, one of the most homophobic. We are
ready to give up our stereotypes about him, overcome our fear and show that Marzan is also Berlin! And both
at Nollendorfplatz and Landsberger Alley we can feel comfortable and safe. We are not enemies, we live in the same city,
and the only thing we should fight against is our stereotypes about each other. \
 \
We want to talk about our identity. What it is like to be a migrant and at the same time gay, lesbian, bi/pan or
trans-person* in Germany. We also want to talk about the dangers faced by the LGBT+ community in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia \
 \
The language of war and hatred plunges us all into an atmosphere of intolerance, anxiety and fear, no one needs it.
We believe that at a celebration of openness and diversity, we will be able to get to know each other a little bit better
and change our ideas about each other. \
 \
After unprecedented isolation, we are ready for radical contact! \
 \
We invite everyone to Marzan Pride 2020!
