Six years ago, we marched in Marzahn for the very first time. It was bold. It was a little scary. But it was truly important.

Since then, we've marched with various slogans—inspiring and provocative, personal and political. But always sincere. We’ve come to speak openly — about our rights, about our identities, about the freedom to be ourselves.

And over these years, we’ve come a long way. And the most important part of this journey isn't just the fight for visibility, but the opportunity to stand alongside others, to hear and to be heard.

Over six years, Marzahn Pride has become an event that unites very different people around simple yet crucial values: acceptance, solidarity, respect, and the right to live without fear.

And we’re proud to be building this space together.

But we also see how society is becoming increasingly radicalized worldwide, and we fear where this might lead. It's becoming more noticeable: people stop hearing and listening to each other, while fear and hatred are used as politicians' primary tools.

Many of us know exactly what that looks like — because we’ve had to leave our homes, escaping authoritarian regimes, wars, and dictatorships.

That's why participating in this pride isn't just an act of solidarity. It's a necessity.

We stand for open and honest conversation. We stand for bringing people together, not tearing them apart. We believe that our greatest strength lies in our diversity — in our ability to meet each other with respect, curiosity, and care. That’s how we move forward. That’s how we build a better future.

We say: We are different. We are together.

And we invite everyone who shares these values — everyone who believes in a world free from discrimination and violence — to join us. Walk with us. Stand with us. For human rights. For dignity. For equality. For all of us.
