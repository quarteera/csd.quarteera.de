On **June 15, 2024**, the association of Russian-speaking LGBTQ* activists, Quarteera, will stand the 5th Marzahn Pride in the Marzahn Berlin.

Five years ago, Quarteera e.V. first took to the streets of Marzahn in the name of love, equality, and inclusivity. This year, we march under the banner "Queer as Freedom," in solidarity with those fighting for their rights and freedoms.

**Gathering at 11:30 on the street opposite Kaufland. The march starts at 12:30.**

After the march, a traditional street festival will be held from **14:30** to 19:00 at **[Victor-Klemperer-Platz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12PfkDRWKR8yqouCA)**.
